# Schedule

## Target

This session aims to introduce you to discrete choice models and demonstrate how to use these models in your research. By the end of the session, you should be equipped to conduct preliminary empirical research using discrete choice models.

## Session Time

- We will start from 10 am to 12 am in the morning, and continue our session from 2.30 pm in the afternoon.

### Plain Logit Model

- Description:
  In this session, we will explore the plain logit model. You will learn what a plain logit model is, how to fit a dataset using this model, and how to use the estimated model for welfare calculations. Additionally, we will cover the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method and optimization techniques. 

## June 27

### Generalized Extreme Value Model

**Description:**
This session will focus on Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) models, specifically the nested logit model, which is widely used in various fields. We will demonstrate how to estimate a nested logit model and introduce the methods of simulated likelihood (MSL) and simulated moments (MSM) for estimation.

## June 28

### Random Utility Model and BLP Method

**Description:**
We will begin by introducing the random utility model and the mixed logit model, commonly used to represent random utilities. Then, we will discuss how to estimate a random utility model without individual-level data and solve such models using the BLP method.
